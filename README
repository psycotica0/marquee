This utility will take in an input string, and a size, and cut it down to be that size.
Then, it will store its state in /tmp/marquee, which will be a single integer meaning the number of characters to skip.
Once run it will update that to be one greater.

Once the value is the same as string length it will make the value -(requested length), which means to put that many spaces before the input.

This means will mean that every time it is run it will show a different part of the text.

For example, if our input string is "0123456789"
Then running `marquee 3` the first time will give us "012" and put "1" into /tmp/marquee.

Then, the next run will be "123" and "2" into /tmp/marquee.
It will proceed as:
234
345
456
567
678
789
89 
9  
   
At this point it will put "-2" into /tmp/marquee, which will render "  0", then:
 01
012

etc.
